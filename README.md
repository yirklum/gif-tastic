# gif-tastic

The name of this app is Psycho-Zoology (a term I made up) and features GIFs of animals expressing their feelings. This includes grumpy cats, angry pandas, confused otters, hungry hamsters, mellow koalas, sleepy pugs, playful meerkats and other options.

In this app a user clicks on a button (containing the name of a specific animal) and 10 GIFs based on a search of that animal pop up. They are initially still images, but the GIFs can be started and stopped when clicked upon. The user can enter the name of another animal (or anything they want) and a new button will be created.

This app was constructed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, JSON and AJAX and utilizes the Giphy API. I also used Photoshop to construct a collage of expressive animals for the header section.
